# Email Backup Tool

The Email Backup Tool is a Python script for backing up emails from an IMAP mailbox to the local file system. It provides a convenient way to create backups of emails stored on an IMAP server.

## Features

- Connects to an IMAP mailbox server securely using SSL/TLS.
- Retrieves a list of available mailbox folders.
- Creates local backup folders for storing email backups.
- Fetches and stores emails by their IDs.
- Displays progress bars using tqdm library.
- Gracefully handles interruptions (e.g., Ctrl+C) during the backup process.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ludndev/tool-backup-emails
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

Prepare a CSV file named `accounts.csv` containing email account details (email, password, server, port) in the root directory.

## Command-line Interface (CLI) Options

The Email Backup Tool supports the following command-line options:

- `-h, --help`: Display the help message and exit.
- `--zip ZIP`: Specifies the maximum size in MB for each archive.
- `--backup BACKUP`: Specifies the path of the backup folder. (Default: `backups`)

```
Replace `/path/to/backup/folder` with the desired destination folder for storing backups.

```bash
python email_backup_tool.py --account list_account.csv
```

4. Backup emails on single account:
